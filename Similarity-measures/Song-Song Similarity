What DATA we have: 
  Song meta data : (Song-id , Title , Released by , Artist ,Year )
 
Both 'Title' and 'Released by' are the in sentences format in english and latin words. So similarity based on these features require Text Analysis.

So the similarity will be based on 'Artist' and the 'Year'.

Decreasing order of similarity weightage for two songs
  :: Two songs having same 'Artist' and 'year'
  :: Two songs having different 'Artist' but same 'Year'
  :: Two songs having same 'Artist' name and 'Year' within +5/-5 range (Less the difference , more the Weightage) 
  :: Two songs having different 'Artist' and 'Year' within +5/-5 range
  :: Two songs having different 'Artist' and 'Year' out of +5/-5
